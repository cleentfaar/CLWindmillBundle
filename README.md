# Features

- Easy to use services and demo templates to access the Windmill engine and view your chess games with, just check out the [DemoController](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLWindmillBundle/tree/master/Controller/DemoController.php)!
- Save and load your chess games (currently supports `file` and `orm` storage, but you can [easily add your own](https://github.com/cleentfaar/windmill/tree/master/Resources/doc/custom-storage-adapter.md)).
- [Custom Twig extension](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLWindmillBundle/tree/master/Resources/doc/twig.md) so you can display chess games anywhere in your templates
- Cool little [console command](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLWindmillBundle/tree/master/Resources/doc/console.md) so you can even play a game of chess through the CLI!


## Why the bundle?

The aim of this bundle is to make it easier to work with the many (decoupled, but related) services inside the engine by
using the same DIC and templating patterns that are already provided by the framework. Since I use the Symfony Framework
for almost all of my own projects, it has become much easier to just adopt my work on their fundamentals.

The reason behind the actual chess engine can be read in it's own documentation [here](https://github.com/cleentfaar/windmill).
