# Usage

## Playing chess through the browser

Either add the `@CLWindmillBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml` to your `app/config/routing.yml` file, or create your
own `GameController` by looking at how [the original](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLWindmillBundle/tree/master/Controller/GameController.php)
was made.

Then, if you used the default controller, just navigate to `/windmill/game/new/` to start a new game of chess.


## Playing chess through the CLI (Symfony Console)

Check out the documentation on [Commands](https://github.com/cleentfaar/CLWindmillBundle/tree/master/Resources/doc/commands.md).
